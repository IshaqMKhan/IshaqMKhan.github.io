<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a deep learning and computer vision researcher with a strong interest in applying AI to real-world problems, particularly in healthcare. My work bridges core machine learning techniques and domain-specific challenges in medical imaging, where I develop and optimize deep learning models for tasks like disease detection and image-based diagnosis. I am driven by the potential of AI to improve decision-making, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and support impactful research across disciplines.
