<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a deep learning and computer vision researcher with a strong interest in applying AI to real-world problems, particularly in healthcare and other data-intensive domains. I have extensive experience applying advanced deep learning models, including CNNs, Transformers, and diffusion models, to real-world data. My work combines core deep learning techniques with domain-specific challenges, where I develop models for tasks such as medical image analysis, visual recognition, and decision support systems. I am driven by the potential of AI to improve decision-making, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and support impactful research across disciplines, from clinical diagnostics to general computer vision problems.
