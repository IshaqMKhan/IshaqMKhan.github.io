<p style="text-align: justify;"> In this work, we propose a hybrid deep learning model that combines DenseNet169 with a custom attention module for accurate osteoporosis detection using knee radiographs. The fused features are classified through a fully connected network, achieving strong performance and outperforming state-of-the-art methods. </p>
